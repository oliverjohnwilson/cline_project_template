# 030 - Architecture Decision Records

Purpose
- Capture significant decisions and their context for future maintainers.

When to create an ADR
- Dependency or framework changes, new integration patterns, schema changes, or non-trivial architecture shifts.

Process
- Add a new record under docs/adr using docs/adr/template.md.
- Summarize context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.
- Link ADRs from PR descriptions that implement the change.

Success criteria
- Major decisions have corresponding ADRs linked in PRs.
