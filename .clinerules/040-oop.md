# 040 – Object-Oriented Practices

## Purpose
Ensure OOP is used effectively and not as unnecessary complexity.

## Rules
- **SRP:** One reason to change per class.
- **Composition over Inheritance:** Prefer delegation and protocols.
- **Interfaces:** Use abc.ABC or typing.Protocol for contracts.
- **Immutability:** Use frozen dataclasses for value objects.
- **Small Methods:** ≤ 30 lines, descriptive names.

## Checklist
- [ ] Classes have a single responsibility.
- [ ] No deep inheritance hierarchies.
