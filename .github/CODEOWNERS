# CODEOWNERS (Template)
# This file intentionally contains no personal names to keep the template neutral.
# Uncomment and edit lines below in downstream projects to enable code ownership.
#
# Syntax: https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Example patterns:
# *                 @your-org/your-team
# docs/**           @your-org/docs-team
# src/**            @your-org/engineering
# tests/**          @your-org/qa
#
# Suggested approach:
# - Use organization teams (e.g., @your-org/your-team) rather than individual accounts.
# - Keep ownership coarse-grained (by directory) to avoid churn.
# - Ensure branch protection requires code owner review (optional).
